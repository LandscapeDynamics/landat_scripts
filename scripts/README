This set of R scripts can be used to process annual MODIS NDVI tiff
files to create the full suite of LanDAT maps and measures for the
conterminous US. Follow the 2 steps below to set-up this analysis, then
execute main.R. The scripts will automatically check for, and install
any missing R libraries (see vars.R).

### Step 1) Set-up the run parameters including the full paths to this
directory in vars.R.  Specifically check the following variables:
	bpath
	srcpath
	sptrn   # Prefix name patern of raster files
	mask	# If set to true then a raster called mask.tif is expected
	        #  in same dir as input rasters
        nfac
        rast.format

### Step 2) Execute main.R
